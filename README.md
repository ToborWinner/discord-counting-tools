# discord-counting-tools

A script to generate weird messages that are valid for a Discord counting bot.

## Usage

The command allows you two specify two parameters: mode and number. The number
is required, however you may choose to omit the mode. When the mode is omitted,
it will be randomized.

```
Usage: [mode] <num>
```

A list of modes can be found near the end of `Main.java`.

## Testing without installing

If you have Nix installed and would like to test the program without installing
it, run the following command and replace `<num>` and `[mode]` with the desired
inputs.

```bash
nix run github:ToborWinner/discord-counting-tools -- [mode] <num>
```

# Installation and running

For non-nix users, download the discord-counting-tools.jar file from the latest
release and run it with:

```bash
java -jar discord-counting-tools.jar [mode] <num>
```

You must have Java 23 or higher installed.
